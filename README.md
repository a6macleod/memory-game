# MEMORY GAME

This project was created using React. The goal was to practice using hooks for state, and passing state to other components

## How the game works

The goal of this game is to click all the images only one time. Each time an image is clicked all the images will reorder. Click all twelve images exactly one time and you win!

## Keeping Score

At the top of the page the current score is kept. Each time you click an image for the first time your current score will increase.

If you are playing for the first time or you are reaching your highest score, the "best score" will also increase with your "score". But if you click a picture twice, your best score will remain while your score will reset to zero.
